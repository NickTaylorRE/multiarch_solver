This repository is a solver for a ctf challenge. the challenge is a multiarchitecture VM that takes in a custom binary with its own 2 instruction sets.
i have reimplemented those instruction sets in the solver/ workspace
i'm also building a symbolic execution engine which i will use to solve constraints which need to be solved for the challenge. this is in the symbex/ workspace.

i will need help writing parts of the code. all i want claude to do is familiarize yourself with the codebase by reading the source files and waiting for me to ask questions on how things can be implemented. do not attempt to write to files yourself, just provide suggestions to the chat interface and provide code to the chat interface.
